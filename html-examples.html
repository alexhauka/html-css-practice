selectors, properties, and values:

  CSS selectors are followed by curly braces;
    p {...}

  properties and values of selectors;
    p {
      color: orange;
      font-size: 16px;
    }

  The most common selectors target by type class, or I.D. which vary in scope:
    
    -Type selectors target broadly (all of given type)
    
    -Class selectors are a little more specific in their targeting,
     classes are denoted with dot notation in CSS
    
    -I.D. selectors are most precise targeting one unique element,
     these can only be used once per page (reserve them for significant elements),
     denoted by a preceeding hashtag in CSS

    There are more advanced selectors available.




<div> and <span> are exceptions to the rule of semantic code. 
They are used as containers to apply targeted styles to contained content

<div> is block-level element (sually used for large groupings of content)

<span> is inline-level element (usually used for small groupings within a block level element)

<header> vs. <head> vs. <h1> through <h6> Elements:

  It is easy to confuse the <header> element with the <head> element or the heading elements, <h1> through <h6>. They all have different semantic meanings and should be used according to their meanings. For reference…

  The <header> element is a structural element that outlines the heading of a segment of a page. It falls within the <body> element.

  The <head> element is not displayed on a page and is used to outline metadata, including the document title, and links to external files. It falls directly within the <html> element.

  Heading elements, <h1> through <h6>, are used to designate multiple levels of text headings throughout a page.




Deciding Between <article>, <section>, or <div> Elements:

  At times it becomes fairly difficult to decide which element—<article>, <section>, or <div>—is the best element for the job based on its semantic meaning. The trick here, as with every semantic decision, is to look at the content.

  Both the <article> and <section> elements contribute to a document’s structure and help to outline a document. If the content is being grouped solely for styling purposes and doesn’t provide value to the outline of a document, use the <div> element.

  If the content adds to the document outline and it can be independently redistributed or syndicated, use the <article> element.

  If the content adds to the document outline and represents a thematic group of content, use the <section> element.




Encoding Special Characters:
  The <h3> element within our <header> element, as well as the <small> element within our <footer> element, has some interesting things going on. Specifically, a few special characters within these elements are being encoded.

  Special characters include various punctuation marks, accented letters, and symbols. When typed directly into HTML, they can be misunderstood or mistaken for the wrong character; thus they need to be encoded.

  Each encoded character will begin with an ampersand, &, and end with a semicolon, ;. What falls between the ampersand and semicolon is a character’s unique encoding, be it a name or numeric encoding.

  For example, we would encode the word “resumé” as resum&eacute;. Within our header we have encoded both en and em dashes, and within our footer we have encoded the copyright symbol. 


Relative Path example (linking to page on same site):
<a href="about.html">About</a>

Absolute Path example (linking to external site):
<a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>




Email Links:

    To create an email link, the href attribute value needs to start with mailto: followed by the email address to which the email should be sent. To create an email link to shay@awesome.com, for example, the href attribute value would be mailto:shay@awesome.com.

Additionally, subject, body text, and other information for the email may be populated. To add a subject line, we’ll include the subject= parameter after the email address. The first parameter following the email address must begin with a question mark, ?, to bind it to the hyperlink path. Multiple words within a subject line require that spaces be encoded using %20.

Adding body text works in the same way as adding the subject, this time using the body= parameter in the href attribute value. Because we are binding one parameter to another we need to use the ampersand, &, to separate the two. As with the subject, spaces must be encoded using %20, and line breaks must be encoded using %0A.

    example:

    <a href="mailto:shay@awesome.com?subject=Reaching%20Out&body=How%20are%20you">Email Me</a>

Opening links in a new window:

  To trigger the action of opening a link in a new window, use the target attribute with a value of _blank. The target attribute determines exactly where the link will be displayed, and the _blank value specifies a new window.

  example:
    
    <a href="http://shayhowe.com/" target="_blank">Shay Howe</a>

Linking to parts of the same page:

  We can create an on-page link by first setting an id attribute on the element we wish to link to, then using the value of that id attribute within an anchor element’s href attribute.

Using the “Back to top” link as an example, we can place an id attribute value of top on the <body> element. Now we can create an anchor element with an href attribute value of #top, pound sign and all, to link to the beginning of the <body> element.

  example:

    <body id="top">
  ...
  <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
  ...
</body>
